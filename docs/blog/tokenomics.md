# USDS Tokenomics

USDS uses a non-collateralized, elastic supply model designed to maintain price stability and protocol utility.

## ðŸ”„ Elastic Supply

USDS adjusts its circulating supply in response to demand:

- **Expansion**: When demand rises, more USDS is minted algorithmically.
- **Contraction**: When demand falls, supply contracts through protocol-driven mechanisms.

This keeps the value anchored around a target peg (typically $1).

## ðŸ“Š Demand Feedback Loops

Supply changes are triggered based on:

- Market signals
- Protocol health metrics
- Time-based rebalancing cycles

## ðŸŽ¯ Incentives

Users and agents interact with the protocol via:

- **Minting & Redemption incentives**
- **Fee distributions**
- **Governance participation**

The model promotes long-term alignment between users, developers, and protocol health.

USDS doesnâ€™t just mimic fiat stabilityâ€”it reimagines it through automation, decentralization, and intelligent incentives.
