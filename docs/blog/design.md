# Design Principles

USDS is engineered on the belief that decentralized money should be:

## 1. Neutral by Default

No central controller. No human discretion. USDS operates on fixed rules that apply equally to everyone.

## 2. Programmatically Enforced

All monetary policy and coordination mechanisms are expressed in smart contractsâ€”transparent, auditable, and immutable.

## 3. Scalable and Efficient

Built on Solana to take advantage of high throughput, parallel execution, and millisecond-level state updates.

## 4. Transparent & Open Source

The USDS protocol is open to all. The source code and economic logic are available for review, audit, and contribution.

These principles guide every technical and economic decision we make in the development of USDS.
