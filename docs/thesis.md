# The USDS Thesis

## 🧭 Vision

USDS is built to serve as the **base monetary layer** for a new autonomous economy. Unlike traditional stablecoins, USDS is not backed by fiat or crypto collateral—it is governed purely by algorithms, code, and economic incentives.

We believe that money should be:

- **Neutral** – Free from centralized control or censorship.
- **Verifiable** – Transparent and enforced by deterministic code.
- **Composable** – Ready to integrate across decentralized systems and agents.

## 💡 Why a New Stable Asset?

Today’s stablecoins rely heavily on:

- **Custodians** holding fiat reserves.
- **Collateral** that can lose value or be mismanaged.
- **Governance decisions** by centralized entities.

These approaches introduce friction, opacity, and risk.

USDS takes a different path: a **purely algorithmic and trustless design** where stability arises from the protocol’s feedback loops and logic—not outside intervention.

## 🧪 The Core Hypothesis

A **non-collateralized elastic currency** can remain stable when:

- **Supply expands** during demand surges.
- **Supply contracts** during drops in usage.
- Users, markets, and automated agents coordinate around an on-chain equilibrium point.

This creates an environment where USDS acts as a predictable **unit of account** and **medium of exchange** across decentralized ecosystems.

## 🔄 Autonomous Coordination Layer

USDS is more than a stablecoin. It is a programmable **substrate for economic coordination**—designed to be embedded in:

- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
- Lending protocols
- DAOs
- Autonomous agents and bots

By providing a stable and predictable asset, USDS becomes the **foundation layer** for complex decentralized behaviors.

## 📌 Conclusion

USDS represents the evolution of digital money:

- **No custodians**
- **No collateral**
- **No human discretion**

Just code, markets, and consensus.

This thesis guides every technical and economic decision behind the protocol.

> “If Bitcoin is sound money, USDS is **adaptive money**—stable by design, autonomous by nature.”
