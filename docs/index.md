## üåê What is USDS?

USDS is engineered to function as a **programmable and autonomous financial primitive**, moving beyond traditional stablecoin models. Its key characteristics include:

- **Non-custodial**: Users retain full control over their assets without relying on intermediaries.
- **Algorithmic Equilibrium**: Supply adjusts automatically in response to market dynamics, eliminating the need for manual intervention or collateral reserves.
- **High-Speed Transactions**: Leveraging Solana's infrastructure for rapid and scalable operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Principles

### Elastic Monetary Base

USDS dynamically expands and contracts its supply based on real-time market signals, ensuring stability without the need for centralized control or asset backing.

### Impartial Infrastructure

Governed entirely by transparent, on-chain logic, USDS operates as a trustless system free from human bias, providing a neutral foundation for decentralized applications.

### Verifiably Trustless

All operational rules are hard-coded and enforced automatically on-chain, offering an auditable and immutable framework that replaces traditional trust mechanisms with code.
